In this folder the results obtained by testing the four proposed approaches are reported. The Time Dependent Model is tested over 87 instances out of 136. For the remaining models, two sheets are reported: the first one (#\_total) reports the results over all the 136 instances; the second one refers to the 87 instances solved also by the Time Dependent Model.

For each instance, defined by the network, the values of k and b, different information are reported: _status_ is 1 if the instance is solved to optimality, 0 otherwise; _LB_ and _UB_ are the lower and upper bounds returned at termination; _gap[%]_ is the gap at termination; _time[s]_ is the computational time (time limit set to 7200 s); _B&C nodes_ is the number of nodes of the branch and cut at termination; _LB\_r_ is the lower bound at the root node; _gap\_best[%]_ is the gap w.r.t. the best feasible solution found by all the methods; _gap\_r[%]_ is the gap w.r.t. LB\_r. 
Some additional information may be found for some of the methods, e.g. _n_ which is the number of network nodes, _PostProcessed_ which is the number of nodes after preprocessing procedures, _CreationTime_ which is the time needed to create the model (preprocessing procedure, computation of lower bounds e.g.), _#OpenNodes_ number of open B&C nodes, _m_ combinatorial lower bound, _#Violated(x)_ number of cuts of type (x) added to the model.
