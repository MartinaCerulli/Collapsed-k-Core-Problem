In this folder, we collect all the instances used to test the proposed approaches. They may be found online also [here](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/). In each folder, information about the instance (together with its source) and the .gml associated file may be found.
Furthermore, in the pdf [Instance_Description](https://github.com/MartinaCerulli/Collapsed-k-Core-Problem/blob/main/instances/Instances_Description.pdf), a table may be found reporting, for each network, the bibliographic source from which it was collected, the number of its nodes, the number of its edges, the selected k values, as well as the associated sizes of the network after pre-processing and, finally, the selected values for the budget b. Finally, there is an Excel Table describing, for each instance, the cardinality of the k-core in the original graph for different values of k.
